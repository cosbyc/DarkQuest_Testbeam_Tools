Modify the diagram below to represent the detector channels included in your run
(exact spacing needs not be perserved)

  o  - Channel is enabled in the run and will have an ADC value in each event.
  x  - Channel is disabled in the run and will not have an ADC value. This applies to slots where the hodoscope are not sitting.
  T  - Triggered channel, which is also wanted for the offline analysis. This channel must read above T-thresh to be included in event loop.
  V  - Vetoed channel which is not desired in analyzed events. This channel must read below V-thresh to be included in the event loops.
